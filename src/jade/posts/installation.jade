        pre.prettyprint.lang-js
            | npm install jott -g
        p To create a new Jott site, create a directory and run 'jott init'.
        pre.prettyprint.lang-js
            | mkdir jott_site
            | cd jott_site
            | jott init
        p You will then be asked to an enter a name for your blog. This can be changed later by editing the jott.json file in your project's root directory.
        pre.prettyprint.lang-js
            | Enter your Blog's name 
            | -> <Blog name>
        p Jott wil then ask you for a baseUrl. Again, this can be changed in the jott.json file, and if you leave it blank, will default to http://localhost/<project_dir>
        pre.prettyprint.lang-js
            | Enter your Blog's Base URL,
            | Eg: "localhost/blogtest" or "www.joeblogs.com"
            | (This can be changed in jott.json at anytime.)

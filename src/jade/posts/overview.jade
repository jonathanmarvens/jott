        p Jott is an 'opinionated', static blog generator for Node.js hackers.
        p The opinions are as follows:
        ul
            li Navigations, tagging, headers, and categories are superflous for blogging.
            li Jade is superior to Markdown for people who are familiar with Node.js
            li The sole purpose of a blog post is for people to read it. 
        p Jott was created out of frustrations I had with blogging as a service web applications, as well as traditional server side solutions. I also don't like Jekyll. 
        p Jott is available via the NPM.
